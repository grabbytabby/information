# Optical A/V Media Workflows and Recommendations

## Introduction

Due to the nature of their respective standards, media items that are on optical discs require distinct preservation workflows from other types of digital content. The following information presents workflows and tool examples that facilitate the preferred preservation deliverables of UW Libraries for these formats. 

## CDDAs (Audio CDs)


### Background

Audio CDs (known as CD-DA for Compact Disc Digital Audio) contain a raw stream of audio data with an index and thus can't be 'imaged' in the same way as other digital media. Also - due to compromises made between error correction and content, when migrating audio CDs it is important to use specialty software that is capable of multiple passes. (As an example - according to [this paper](https://www.weareavp.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/OpticalMediaPreservation.pdf) by AVP, consumer players average about a 5% error rate).

The following workflow will provide recommendations for suitable software, as well as brief notes on other CD-DA specific considerations.
